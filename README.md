## Prerequisites

- Node > v17.5

## Getting Started

Before attempting anything, ensure you have run `npm i` in this directory to install all dependencies.

## Testing

All tests are in the `test` directory. We use `jest` and `supertest` to test our server. Run `npm t` to execute tests.
There are 2 databases on the system - a development database and a smaller test database that is ran and seeded when tests are ran.
